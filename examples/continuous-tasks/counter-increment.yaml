title: Increment counter value
prompt: |
  Create or update a file called `counter.txt` in the root directory. 
  
  If the file doesn't exist, create it with the number '1'.
  If it exists, read the current number and increment it by 1, then write the new number to the file.
  
  The file should contain only a single number on one line.
  
  Additionally, create or update a `counter_log.txt` file that logs each increment with a timestamp in the format:
  "Count [number] at [timestamp]"
  
  Each run should increment the counter and add a new log entry.
context: |
  This task creates a continuously incrementing counter that will always change on each run.
  The counter will never reach a state where no changes are needed, ensuring continuous work.
