title: Add next prime number
prompt: |
  Create or update a file called `primes.txt` in the root directory.
  
  If the file doesn't exist, create it with the first prime number: '2'.
  If it exists, find the next prime number after the last number in the file and append it on a new line.
  
  Each line should contain exactly one prime number.
  The file should grow with each run, continuing the prime number sequence.
  
  Also maintain a count in a comment at the top of the file:
  # Prime count: [number of primes in file]
  
  Update this count each time you add a new prime.
context: |
  This task generates an infinite sequence of prime numbers. Since there are infinitely many primes,
  there will always be a next prime to find and add, ensuring continuous work for every run.
