# Microservices Architecture Implementation

## Project Overview
We are transitioning our monolithic application to a microservices architecture to improve scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy.

## Current State
- Single monolithic application running on EC2
- MySQL database with 500GB of data
- 100k daily active users
- 15-person engineering team

## Target Architecture

### Core Services
1. **User Service**
   - Authentication and authorization
   - User profile management
   - JWT token management

2. **Product Service**
   - Product catalog
   - Inventory management
   - Search functionality

3. **Order Service**
   - Order processing
   - Payment integration
   - Order history

4. **Notification Service**
   - Email notifications
   - SMS notifications
   - Push notifications

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Service mesh (Istio)
- API Gateway (Kong)
- Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- Centralized logging (ELK stack)

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up Kubernetes cluster
- Configure CI/CD pipelines
- Implement service discovery

### Phase 2: Extract User Service (Weeks 3-4)
- Identify boundaries
- Create API contracts
- Implement service
- Migrate data

### Phase 3: Extract Product Service (Weeks 5-6)
- Similar process as User Service
- Ensure backward compatibility

### Phase 4: Extract Order Service (Weeks 7-8)
- Handle distributed transactions
- Implement saga pattern

### Phase 5: Complete Migration (Weeks 9-10)
- Decommission monolith
- Performance testing
- Documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All services independently deployable
- [ ] 99.9% uptime maintained
- [ ] Response time < 200ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring in place

## Risk Mitigation
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Blue-green deployments
- Comprehensive rollback procedures
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing

## Team Training
- Kubernetes workshops
- Microservices best practices
- Distributed systems patterns
- Monitoring and debugging techniques
